A first pass at documenting build plugins
A first pass at making sure that all the setter function arguments receive the index of the element and a relevant value to work with. Fixes #5763.
A first pass on some package command error messages
A fix for bug #1443, where globalEval occurred asynchronously in Safari 2, provided by Andrea Giammarchi.
A follow-up for bug #3945. ID selectors don't work in querySelectorAll on XML documents, so we just fall back to the normal engine.
A follow-up to [6578] (which stopped adding expandos to elements that didn't have data). That broke jQuery.unique() (so we're now using the unique from Sizzle). Using Sizzle's unique (which also sorts in document order) changed how add, andSelf, parents, nextAll, prevAll, and siblings work. after and before were changed to not use .add() (in order to guarantee their position in the jQuery set). Also, jQuery.data(elem) was updated to return that element's data object (instead of its ID).
A giant benchmarky test
A hack necessary for Android emulation
A hack to parse the host and port
A hack to split package name to builds with archs
A hacky way to get css to work on hcp
A large refactor of the event handling logic. Data and namespace information is maintained in a separate object now, no longer on the event handler. Proxy functions are no longer needed, as a result. Additionally execution order of the handlers is maintained, fixing #4261, and the execution of handlers is maintained even while they're being removed. Live events will be refactored separately.
A little cleanup
A little extra safety belt, in case we're not loaded from app.html.
A little extra whitespace makes things easier to read.

Comprehensive build-time error reporting system. In particular: if an error occurs, the build will try to continue to identify any other potential problems so that they can be flagged too. Syntax errors are captured and dealt with programmatically, rather than just being echoed to stderr by node. Stack traces are parsed to pull out file and line information, and a distinction is made between the 'user' and 'internal' portions of the stack. All of this is at build time only -- it has not been extended to (run-time) server or browser yet. Also, no source maps yet, though line numbers are computed correctly for units within the linker.
Comprehensive namespace cleanup.

Fixd bug for pyenv plugin
Fixe dimensions tests. No core code changes. Supplements #11856
Fixed ")" error
Fixed "Javascript uses use" typo
Fixed "truncate a string" test that was preventing users from completing the challenge
Fixed #1039 and #1733 by going through the core API and making them text node and comment node safe.
Fixed #1070 by converting all setAttribute() values to a string which is what all browsers but IE did.  This will bring IE in line with the others and fix the bug.
Fixed #1074 where .html() was incorrectly changing the selected value of an option.
Fixed #1090
Fixed #1095 bug where radio buttons became unchecked during show(). Also added unit test and had to fix a selector test that was broken by the new testing div in test/index.html. Last made some whitespace changes.
Fixed #1264.  If you read the bug there were many proposed changes.  As it turned out most of them had already been implemented.  The last ones necessary were in .domManip() with when a <table> was 'this' and for .text().  Adding these last changes seems to make dom and text manipulation in IE frames possible.  Unit test cases were added as well.
Fixed #1419 where IE failed with .text() on an XML node.  This is part of a series of tickets including #1264 where the context of the DOM manipulation was a problem in xml and iframe documents.
Fixed #1438 where a filter could be set in IE but not have opacity in it. The JS error was fixed by checking to make sure 'opacity=' is in the filter before seeing what its value is.
Fixed #1450 by returning 1223 as success.  Couldn't normalize the status since jquery uses the actual xmlhttprequest object.
Fixed #1474, setting selectedIndex
Fixed #1557, although it doesn't appear to be just an FF3 problem. In this case, $.getJSON() wasn't working from a remote host. I went ahead and added a unit test then added the s.dataType == "json" test for a remote <script> load.  The said that json was allowed but the dataType check was missing. This appears to have fixed the bug across all browsers.
Fixed #1599 as Brandon suggested to ignore negative values to width and height css.  The fix itself is slightly different as it was moved to .css() instead of staying in .attr() like in his patch.  I decided there was less chance of incorrect behavior (like if someone had an XML file with a width attribute that could be negative).  Also took out some unneeded white space while I was in there.
Fixed #1701 by passing through the arguments as suggested.
Fixed #1714 by adding a default empty string if the value is falsey.
Fixed #1727 bug where :nth-child() was non-standard with CSS3 plus two minor white space changes in selector.js.
Fixed #1750 by adding a url that starts with "//" and is a dataType "script" will now use a cross domain load the same as urls that start with "http".
Fixed #1763 by checking to see if .createElement() is available on the context and if isn't default to other contexts.
Fixed #1781 for warnings created on load by FF javascript.options.strict == true.
Fixed #1813
Fixed #1820
Fixed #1822 bug where queue() didn't always default to type 'fx'.
Fixed #1848
Fixed #1849
Fixed #1854 by using wizzud's suggestion.  The only real difference is the code is only called when there is more than a single selector.  So there should be no speed decrease in the current working cases.  Only additional functionality for cases that used to fail.
Fixed #1876; fixed some grammar issues; adhered to JS comment conventions
Fixed #1887 - trigger fails if extra is not a function
Fixed #1908 by testing to make sure it isn't null before checking the nodeType.
Fixed #1909 #1972
Fixed #1926
Fixed #1942 but running jQuery.css() before jQuery.curCSS().  This way when the property is width or height it gets the values through calculation instead of just css first. This appears to fix the problem in Opera without hurting any of the other browsers.
Fixed #1944
Fixed #1959 by postponing ALL script evaluations till the html insertion is done. Before the code would immediately execute any scripts that weren't in subelements if no subelements prior had scripts in them (i.e. once any script was postponed they all were). This could cause inconsistent behavior. Since, at this time, we have to postpone some scripts it makes more sense to postpone them all.
Fixed #1970 by returning true instead of false when the mouse moves over a sub-element.  The side effect is the event will not stop default behavior and will propagate which it didn't used to.  I could find no compelling reason to stop those things from happening.
Fixed #1980
Fixed #1982
Fixed #1999 by replacing the 'no-cache' parameter if it is there instead of just appending.
Fixed #2027 - make sure that cloned elements (within appendTo, etc.) have their events cloned by default.
Fixed #2037 where Opera would mis-state the value of 'display' after an innerHTML was done in some cases.
Fixed #2046 by forcing the dataType to 'html' in the .load() function.
Fixed #2049
Fixed #2062 by adding a check to see if the selector is array-like in .not() before testing it as an array.  Otherwise it does a straight comparison during the filter test.
Fixed #2064
Fixed #2069. The ready helper and shortcuts act the same. You can also still bind, unbind and trigger the ready event on the document element but doing so follows the events API unlike the ready helper method.
Fixed #2070 by adding a test for !nodeType to isArrayLike so DOM elements like SELECT are not considered array-like (even though they really are).
Fixed #2076 where .val() could return an array instead of undefined when the jquery object was empty.  The bug was created during the .val() refactoring for the javascript strict FF ticket.
Fixed #2077 by adding a var to make it a local variable instead of initializing a global one.
Fixed #2080 by removing the check for nodeType != 1.  It was put in to limit the queuing to just dom objects (ie not text nodes and comment nodes), but the queuing functionality is being used more broadly than I realized so the check is now removed.
Fixed #2084 by added embed to the list of elements where it is ok to have self closing xhtml.
Fixed #216, added several tests for ajax module and fixed more stuff revealed by those; Reverted Johns change for each (changeset 433), caused way too much trouble
Fixed #2174 by removing the s.dataType == "json" check for possible cross domain since it causes absolute urls to use a <script> tag ajax retrieval even though absolute urls work fine for retrieving local data.  Cross-domain jsonp will still work since the $.ajax() function actually changes the s.dataType to "script" before it reaches this check in cases where it is s.dataType == "jsonp" or s.dataType == "json" and a parameter has =? in it.

Fixed and improved jQuery's event system: The target property of the event object is now fixed (IE and Safari), bind() accepts now a third parameter "amount" to run the function only the specified number of times, oneclick etc. uses this new bind - it removes the handler when it is not necessary anymore, therefore providing better performance, see accordion for test/demo ( http://joern.jquery.com/accordion/accordion.html )

Fixes #7912. Make sure .cur() only returns 0 as fallback value when it needs to ("", auto, undefined, null).
Fixes #7922. Copy the donor event when simulating a bubbling submit in IE so that we don't accidentally stop propagation on it. Remove a bunch of return statements that could also cancel the event. DRY out the liveFired change from #6359 by moving it to the trigger() function.
Fixes #7943: typo in makefile
Fixes #7945. Make jQuery.param() serialize plain objects with a property named jquery correctly.
Fixes #8001: add IDs for example inputs
Fixes #8054 by reverting feature enhancement 5812 (4920). Regexps no longer searches for %3F in url or data to find jsonp callback placeholders.
Fixes #8082. Text to script converter now returns text. Unit test added.
Fixes #8093: Removes invalid focus styles on inputs
Fixes #8095. Properly handles the case where browser cache needs to be bypassed while server-side logic still delivers proper 304 responses. Unit test added.
Fixes #8098. Use the fast document.head when available. Don't set unneeded "script.type = text/javascript".
Fixes #8099 using iframe to capture an element's real default display; suggested by lrbabe/louisremi
Fixes #8115. Renames all references to jXHR with jqXHR in the code (like was done in the doc).
Fixes #8125. Status is set to 200 for requests with status 0 when location.protocol if "file:". Added test/localfile.html to control it works.
Fixes #8129. Fix cloning multiple selected options in IE8.
Fixes #8135. Makes sure any exception thrown by Firefox when trying to access an XMLHttpRequest property when a network error occured is caught and notified as an error. Added test/networkerror.html to test the behavior.
Fixes #8138. Access to document.location is made only once at load time and if it fails (throwing an exception in IE when document.domain is already set), we use the href of an A element instead.
Fixes #8146 by introducing the xhrFields option with is a map of fieldName/fieldValue to set on the native xhr. Can be used to set withCredentials to true for cross-domain requests if needed.
Fixes #8146. Custom fields in xhrFields are now set after the XMLHttpRequest object has been opened.
Fixes #8150: add `.static-form-control` for vertical alignment of static form text
Fixes #8152 by applying the same special cases for protocol "chrome-extension:" as were for "file:" (needs tests). Re-organizes and fixes the handling of special cases for HTTP status code in the xhr transport. Also re-organizes the handling of document.location in ajax.js.
Fixes #8154: enforce full width `.navbar-nav.pull-right` in mobile
Fixes #8159: Be more specific about disabled inputs to avoid iOS bug
Fixes #8175: Update input min-height vars to fix FF21 input rendering
Fixes #8177. XHR transport now considers 304 Not Modified responses as 200 OK if no conditional request header was provided (as per the XMLHttpRequest specification).
Fixes #819
Fixes #8203. Remove some misguided nulling of elements done in the name of IE memory cleanup. Based on a patch by davidmurdoch in pull 226.
Fixes #8205. Mitigates memory usage by recycling jsonp callback names the safest possible way (no kittens were harmed in the making of this). Doesn't even try to delete window properties (would necessitate a try/catch for IE which makes the cost in size prohibitive). Unit tests added.
Fixes #8211: restore proper table grid class behavior
Fixes #8219. Introduces the mimeType option to override content-type header in conversion (and in native xhr when possible). Adds companion overrideMimeType method on jqXHR object (it simply sets the option). Unit test added.
Fixes #822. Deps.flush hides Error.message.
Fixes #8245. Ajax now ensures header names are capitalized so that non-compliant xhr implementations don't override them.
Fixes #8266: remove unnecessary `strong` and `em` styles
Fixes #8277. Sets data to undefined rather than null when it is not provided in ajax helpers so that it won't revent data set in ajaxSettings from being used. Unit test added.
Fixes #8278: fix  on print
Fixes #8293: sub nav links in JS docs
Fixes #8297. Makes sure response headers with empty values are handled properly and do not prevent proper parsing of the entire response headers string. Unit test amended.
Fixes #8329: add `!important` to `.hidden`
Fixes #8335. Do not allow add data to non-elements (2.x). Closes gh-1232
Fixes #8350: unfuck Chrome number input element cursor /cc @cvrebert @eintnohick

Fixes #8356: Move browser compatibility from wiki into real docs
Fixes #8360: Add mention of IE compatibility mode to docs
Fixes #8374: ensure navbar is always at least 50px
Fixes #8385: update carousel captions
Fixes #8397: better navbar padding with grid gutter stuff
Fixes #8423. Never set X-Requested-With header automagically for cross-domain requests.
Fixes #8441: remove `@font-size-mini`
Fixes #8452: adds `.active` to table classes
Fixes #8456. Make sure parent is not null before crawling into its lap, so mouseenter is triggered on a mouseover event.
Fixes #848. Remove spurious 'cursors' from api docs.
Fixes #85 2px margin for webkit form elements. Thanks Kaelig.
Fixes #850. Publish this.changed unset a field that doesn't exist.
Fixes #8509. Makes URL regexp less overzealous and ensures it recognizes URL schemes which do not contain a conformant hierarchical structure ( as per section 2.1.2 of http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc2718.txt ). Also adds about: and adobe air's app: and app-storage: to the list of local protocols and provides a failover in case document.location is illformed. Unit test added.
Fixes #8516: correct input-small and input-large on select elements
Fixes #8571: allow table classes in thead and tfoot
Fixes #8586: add addional color text classes to apply all of branch colors easily
Fixes #8605: use `.form-control` in `.input-group` instead of HTML tags
Fixes #862
Fixes #8635 again (fix was lost in rewrite). Also removes unnecessary "manual" garbage collection.
Fixes #8692. Strange FF4 bug: values changed onto the arguments object sometimes end up as undefined values outside the $.when method. Cloning the object into a fresh array solves the issue.
Fixes #8712. Bubble custom events to the window when they are triggered. Ride that, Cowboy!
Fixes #8722. Remove try/catch used by #3533 to fix the IE Table Colon Blow bug, and instead check for colon in the event name. Thanks to daguej for scoping this out -- a colonoscopy you might say.
Fixes #8723: allow modals to not need the .fade class /cc @fat
Fixes #8732: unfucks disabled fieldset form example with form groups
Fixes #8744. Makes sure script transport abort method actually removes the script tag even if readyState exists.
Fixes #8749: prevent navbar nav from overlapping navbar toggle
Fixes #8770: mobile-first (stacked by default) horizontal dls
Fixes #8786 (part 1): darken hover states on buttons

Fixes #9073: add note to homepage about download differences
Fixes #9104. Returning null or undefined in a pipe callback shouldn't end up throwing an exception. Silly, silly, me.
Fixes #9109. When jQuery is loaded in the body, then the fake body element used in support has to be inserted before the document's body for boxModel to be properly detected (got the hint by looking at the code in jQuery mobile). Test page added so that we can keep checking this.
Fixes #9145: Fix tooltip opacity
Fixes #9150: Hide popover titles in IE8
Fixes #9221. Wraps openings of html comments and CDATA blocks found at the beginning of inserted script elements into a javascript block comment so that the new implementation of globalEval will not throw an exception in IE (execScript being less lenient than eval). Unit tests added.
Fixes #9239. If the body is already present in the DOM, use a div within it to perform boxModel-related support tests. Unit test added.
Fixes #9255: xml parsing error in $.parseXML is now properly detected for all browsers. Unit test added.
Fixes #9260
Fixes #9415

Fixes #9749: provide js bin link in readme for easier bug reports
Fixes #9752: clear floats in .panel-body
Fixes #9854: propagates native statusText onto jqXHR.statusText. statusText in callbacks is still normalized. Unit test added.
Fixes #9887: ajax now supports circular references into objects passed as context. Prefilter and transport developpers should add their own custom option into flatOptions when needed. Unit test added.
Fixes #9925: convert font data to base64, fixing 0xefbfbd (Unicode Replacement Character) chars in customizer fonts.

On mobile at least, it seems to make sense, and on desktop (assuming this issue would ever show up on desktop), this might be better than returning false or undefined.

Humans.txt prettification
I abhor switch statements, but their indentation should be:
I added a few new books here and there. Notably, I created entries
I blame the cat for this
I broke out the ${...} functionality into a separate plugin so that we can develop it further. I left a hook in jquery.js so that this can be done, plus I left in the function() functionality.
I can compile everything!
I can't spell
I forgot a semi colon...
I guess jquery doesn't support the RC thing
I had to put the check for 'typeof console != "undefined"' back in, otherwise IE complains about console not being defined.
I noticed that for certain projects with unstaged changed I would get a 'U' character instead of the '●' character. This should fix that.
I really hate this markdown thing...
I should not have merged this here.
I take that back! It was a bug, but the cache had to be triggered and a collection of cached nodes had to be passed in (an odd case to be sure). Fixes #6227.
I think I've enabled caching
I think you also want to ignore vendor/bundle...
I've begun the long process of fixing the messed up tab/spaces.
I've cleaned up and documented the events plugin, it's close to being ready for 1.0.
I've completely resolved the known issues with document ready. I use the known DOM ready functions that Mozilla and IE provides. For Opera and Safari I fall back to the original hack, but ignore it, and fall back to window.onload, if there are scripts embedded in the DOM.

ID not Id
IDEA files
IE 9 compat; isParented; beginning of isRemoved
IE 9 preserves the case of the Alpha filter - maintain it in the test as well.
IE conditional classes moved to html tag. Fixes #44
IE doesn't care for boolean checks of .createElement - reverted back to using typeof instead.
IE doesn't like doing attaching the mergeNum property to XML documents, so for now, we're just going to (possibly) return duplicates in IE, in XML documents. (bug #1357).
IE doesn't seem to like caching fragments that have options in them. Ticket #4883.
IE fixes
IE flicker has been killed and setAuto now works in Firefox and IE.
IE is now forced layout if it doesn't have it (such that opacity now works as expected). (Ticket #4).
IE mystery solved
IE prunes whitespace from the start of innerHTML-injected strings. This fixes that.
IE support
IE10 fix in responsive utilities, not regular utilities
IE10 uses 'transition' and 'transitionend'
IE11 & current Firefox are still affected.
IE6 dd_belatedpng call added for posterity
IE6 will shrink-wrap elements with layout instead of allowing content to flow outside of the border-box. Add a test for this and do not remove the overflow property after an animation in IE6.
IE7 fixes for split buttons and dropdowns
IE7 throws an error if you use unquoted false or true as a key in object literals.
IE8 Compatibility fixes
IE8 compatible fix for disabled button hover
IE8 does not have a setter for property "enctype"
IE8 doesn't need help with responsive images, they work just dandy apparently (see http://jsbin.com/idesit/1)
IE8 fix for StyleAttrHandler.
IE8 fix. eval doesn't actually return a value.
IE8 style fixes
IE8 support in jasmine-support
IE8 testing for lowercasing the css properties on retrieving style; had assumed the style support check failed in IE8, which it now does
IE9's support for SVG elements unfortunately does not extend to clearAttributes. Checks for its presence before proceeding.
IMPROVED: untracked file status has priority over modified (ie: if you have both modified and untracked files, your prompt will be red indicating the presence of untracked files)
INCREMENT THE RELEASE NUMBER

If Meteor.http.call JSON-ifies the request body, default the Content-Type to
If Meteor.settings.public exists, make it available on the client as well.
If Package.ecmascript is installed, use it to compile shell commands.
If SDK is not installed when adding platform, prompt to install-sdk and add platform
If USE_GLOBAL_ADK is specified, don't try to
If a plugin fails to build, watch its sources
If an inline handler returns false, call event.preventDefault(). Fixes #6337.
If fixed is set externally, make it sticky.
If foo changes, than foo.bar observation result may change.
If for some reason your user has no published fields, make sure Meteor.user()
If multiple nodes match key, exit extras.
If no hook is provided, and a boolean property exists, use that to return an attribute-style value for boolean attributes. Fixes #9079.
If no links are present, the template does not show the helpful links header.
If oplog tailing gets too far behind, just poll
If present, use changedTouches[0] for d3.mouse.
If selftest fails because of extra-junk, print that extra-junk
If the XHR object no longer exists assume that the request was aborted.
If the format type is "d", only accept integers.
If user is already logged in, link google oauth with that existing account
If verbose, pass --verbose to cordova run
If we are opening a local minimongo collection, and are not defined as the client, then the server can be null, but we should still be able to connect to a local minimongo db.There are not any cases where the conenction is null, where we would want to proceed.
If we're using an arch-specific, auto-downloaded dev_bundles kit, get rid of the bundled node_modules
If xhr.response errors, callback with error.
If you @export Foo.Bar.Baz, define Foo.Bar for you
If you're trying to install and already have it installed, update instead.

MSTransitionEnd + move paren (thanks rick waldron)
Made 'jQuery' unrollable via .noConflict(true) and instances of new Function() have been converted to eval(function(){}) in order to handle jQuery name changes. (Bug #1393)
Made .clone(true) also copy over element data. Fixes #4191.
Made .show() and .hide() use .animate() only if speed argument is truthy or 0.
Made .show(null/undefined) and .hide(null/undefined) work the same as .show() and .hide().
Made JavaScript unobtrusive by factoring out prettyPrint() to application.js. Also removed unused class from hero demo.
Made a bunch of changes to the build system.
Made a bunch of changes to the way that the $() compatability code is handled.
Made a bunch of fixes to the docs, per Sam's request. Also, did some re-organization of the order of the function names.
Made a mistake in the patch for #3618, landing fix.
Made a note about the push method.
Made a number of changes/improvements to how the effects are handled.
Made a number of spacing changes to bring the code more-inline with the jQuery Core Style Guideline.
Made a number of stylistic changes to the offset code (braces, declarations, etc.).
Made a number of syntax tweaks to ajax.js.
Made a slight adjustment to $("expr") to make it faster.
Made a small change to fastclick docs
Made a tweak to the fx queue test (was randomly failing in its current incarnation).
Made a useful new command for mangling version numbers
Made a version of diffQuery ordered that uses the observeChanges callback structure
Made all the arguments for htmlcompressor part of config file. Also added optional additional arguments list in project.properties. Fixes #672
Made changes to instructions as suggested by @jrtmns; closes #1282
Made commands use local cordova
Made git ignore everything  in custom, not only the .zsh files.
Made gravatar consistent with the rest of the form in Profile Information section
Made hide, show, toggle, slideUp, slideDown, and slideToggle animate margins and paddings in addition to height, width, and opacity (results in a much-smoother animation).
Made isObjectLiteral to work correctly with custom objects with empty prototypes.
Made isPlainObject() supporting null, undefined, and window values on IE too. Also added some related tests. Fixes #5669.
Made it so edit will only be displayed for the user. Since its on client side (following practices used) a final check should be used when actually saving edit to db
Made it so that appendTo, etc. return the inserted elements (thus using pushStack, as well). Fixes bugs #3966 and #4182.
Made it so that search input elements are now serialized. Fixes bug #4107.
Made it so that the height/width auto is only called when 'show' is executed.
Made it so that the last return value is always returned from handle() (unless one of the return values was false, in which case the return value is false). (Bug #1416)
Made it so that you can bind a single function to multiple .live() selectors. Additionally, simplified the proxy code to provide a default proxy function. 
Made it so that you can pass in an event object to the trigger data args and it'll override the custom event object (this way you can pass in the event object of a mousemove to a drag event trigger, for example).
Made it so that you can set the text value of elements to numbers (in addition to strings). (Fix for bug #1386)
Made it so that you can't change the type of an input element, having it throw an exception instead (except for input elements that haven't yet been injected into the DOM). (Bug #1536)
Made it so that you no longer need to build jQuery in order to run the test suite (but you'll still need a checkout of QUnit and Sizzle, at least).
Made it so the folders only get ingored in the root
Made jQuery's internal trigger method return the value from handle. (Bug #1417)
Made jQuery('<div/>') and jQuery('<div></div>') use the same code path (making the second one faster). Fixes #5293.
Made jQuery.extend(true, ...) to extend recursively only 'object literal' values.
Made jQuery.type more consistent with host objects.
Made links to external projects in package section more consistent.
Made more formatting changes to manipulation.js. Also moved all inline RegExp into a top declaration.
Made my them display the current rvm gemset and check for detached head
Made names.json alphabetical so that it doesn't change
Made node point to local node
Made outerHeight/outerWidth accept .outerWidth(true) to include the margin. If any options are passed in it's assumed that you want the margin included.
Made panel-variant apply styles only to first child
Made significant changes to the expression engine. Is now significantly faster (4-10x). It passes the test suite (but be sure to let me know if there are any regressions).
Made single quotes to double quotes
Made some additional tests for #5785.
Made some changes to how .find() works, inlined the duplicate check - should change other methods to act similarly. Goes towards fixing #4240.
Made some changes to the form plugin, to simplify it and bring it up to date.
Made some code tweaks related to running jQuery through JSLint (thanks to Lorin Larson for the JSLint run).
Made some minor fixes to how content-type and context is handled on remote XML files.
Made some minor formatting changes to the access function.
Made some spaces optional for 4th test
Made some syntax tweaks to core.js.
Made some tweaks to the core tests so that they'll run better under XHTML.
Made some tweaks to the different AJAX callbacks.
Made sure all file system related statements use proper path.join and path.sep to support other platforms.
Made sure that $.event.handle() always has some form of an event object.
Made sure that .remove now uses multiFilter. Fixes bug #4205.
Made sure that .removeClass(null) doesn't throw an exception. Fixes #3847.
Made sure that a child element exists before the check is done, fixes jQuery bug #3870.
Made sure that a null speed doesn't get passed around. Patch from daltonlp. Fixes #5557.
Made sure that animate callbacks get executed even when no properties are passed in. Fixes #5459.
Made sure that css('width') and height returned string values, not numerical values. Fixes #5627.
Made sure that css() in IE handles negative non-px values correctly. Fixes #3331.
Made sure that return false works in .live() along with the event object being passed in as the first argument.
Made sure that the .val() logic for setting radios and checkboxes was correct. Fixes #5698.
Made sure that the correct event.taget is being used in event bubbling.
Made the .unqiue() within .find() optional (speeds up calls).
Made the IE frameElement check more explicit. Fixes #3880.
Made the case specific of the type attribute.
Made the closest method evaluate the selector with appropriate context.
Made the div showing a little more explicit - making sure that it doesn't affect the fx tests.
Made the error message equal to "timeout", if the request timed out. (Bug #970)
Made the expando code attach properties to an anonymous object, as opposed to the global window object, and fixed a bug where .removeAttribute() tried to fire even if it didn't exist.
Made the getAttribute check more explicit - comment nodes don't have getAttribute in XUL documents. Fixes jQuery bug #3870.
Made the licensing verbiage a little more explicit. Thanks to Dan Montgomery for the suggestion.
Made the message comparison more strict
Made the parsing engine extensible.
Made the user_machine_size calculation generic. Pwned the function name.

Opera 12.0 still implements an older version of the DOM so cloneNode cannot be called without an argument
Opera 12.10 supports unprefixed CSS animations, gradients, transforms, and transitions or will use -webkit.
Opera 9.2 was interpreting .5 as 0.50, changing it to .55 lets the result be the same in all browsers: 0.55. Fixes #5344.
Opera announced they will start supporting the -webkit- prefix for a selected set of css properties. Let's put the inspection of -webkit- prefix properties as the last one in case this propagates to the style object and/or other browsers (the cssPrefixes array is inspected from right to left).
Opera doesn't give height/width of display: none elements with getComputedStyle but does with currentStyle - fall back to that if it exists.
Opera is also vulnerable to the getElementById-returning-name issue, fixed it there as well. Also had to tweak the UTF8 regexps to work in Safari (Safari doesn't support \uXXXX in RegExps, lame.)
Opera was falling back to undefined, which it didn't appreciate.

Safari rounding problem still present as of v7.0.1 for OS X
Safari sometimes stops in the test suite on the ajax section when I run the whole suite and its running on my local machine.

Maybe this is the reason http://www.pearweb.com/javascript/XMLHttpRequest.html

That should have been a string, not a number
The &lt; and &gt; escapes have nothing to do with Unicode.
The 'programs' directory in an app can be used to
The AJAX plugin is now fully documented, along with some bug fixes and new features.
The FCC editor will now catch un-closed comments! This can be extended to catch quotes as well if needed. Fix #1839
The Jumbotron font-size LESS variable now conforms to the '@{bootstrapClass}-font-size' naming scheme.
The Lithium app should be the root repo folder
The actual skeleton for mongo
The android tool requires Java
The awesome logic-solver package begins
The book should not be a header.
The browser.version check was causing browsers with undetected useragents to die. This, at least, makes it fail gracefully.
The bundle doesn't work on linux if made on mac
The cache actually caches!
The changes from dev bundle 0.3.41, merged in
The child selector-prefix branch doesn't work with selectors that have a larger depth. Removing for now - will need to re-evaluate in the future.
The code for handling Ajax timeouts was broken (the abort was being called too early). Fixing this allows the test suite to work again.
The compareDocumentPosition check was extraneous - indexOf works in all the other browsers that we need to support.
The compare_size cache gets wiped out with `grunt clean`
The complete event wasn't getting called on local file 404s. Thanks to 'mrspeaker' for the patch. Fixes #5468.
The constructor check for isPlainObject was redundant, everything still passes without it.
The contents of cache/themes can be safely ignored at least from Sugar 6 onward.
The context for 'body' should still be document, in this case.
The correct links for podcasts are added.
The cssHook from addGetHookIf wasn't actually getting added
The current version of bower is completely unavailable, plugin depth modification
The customizer now displays and collects the new Jumbotron font-size LESS variable
The default for .clone() is to not clone any events. Fixes #8123.
The directory cache/include can also be ignored.
The exact escaping of the text() test isn't important - as long as < is escaped.
The executable command on Mac OSX is 'ack' rather than 'ack-grep'.
The extra & was getting gobbled, oops.
The great reorg of February 2014
The implementation of Heap
The inArray declaration was accidentally duplicated.
The initial versions of published packages should be 1.0.0
The isTimeout fix from #970 was causing unintended status bugs (fixed). This also includes a fix for errors that occurred during an empty eval in IE (but #1410).
The jQuery version is now reported in the docs.
The last
The little book about OS development
The logic for specified option values was already handled by .val(), removed the unnecessary code.
The native box-shadow, background-clip and background-size instructions all take 1 or more arguments. In 1.3.0 LESS became arity aware, see https://gist.github.com/1933613. As a result the signatures of these mixins had to change a little.
The option isn't, necessarily, hidden when this occurs.
The order of <meta> tags, <title>, and charset has been documented more extensively now:
The original SVN pluging would mark a folder as dirty if there was an
The paths for .htaccess, config.php and config_override.php should
The period goes outside the parens (like this).
The period isn't part of the collection name
The quantile scale should ignore null, too.
The reference to awesome-pyramid moved
The rest of the docs for Meteor.settings
The safe-paste plugin now works with tmux, too
The same problem in issue #2648
The script prefilter now forces cross-domain requests type to GET.
The smoke rises
The space key now lets you drag temporarily!
The special.handle hook is for origType, not the mapped type.
The standard app packages are brought in explicitly now.
The sublime-project file should be checked into version control
The test for underscore selectors broke under Opera, so the element is now loaded via Ajax and tested. (bug #1084)
The timeout test was waiting for 10 seconds - unnecessary, lowered it to 1 second.
The tool only needs the ddp client
The triggered flag was being set too early, which was preventing bubbling form working when a 
The unique key warning should only happen in dev.
The unload event no longer needs the IE6SP2 fix, see http://bugs.jquery.com/ticket/8982
The word several is repeated in step 11
The world isn't ready for moving the Ajax methods to jQuery.ajax.*. Hope to move them there some day. Fixes #7146.

There is no need to unignore `.gitignore`.
There only restriction on what you can stick in your Mongo database is now
There was a disabled test in the ajax test suite which said there were too many simultainous requests.  I re-enabled it when I found a bug that might have been the cause of the failure instead and it seems to work fine.  We can disable it again if that ends up not being the case.
There was a redundant word in the sentence
There was an issue with my table/tbody detection.
There's enough logic going on in jQuery.ajaxSettings.xhr to warrant splitting the function based upon the functionality.
There's no isComponentOfType() anymore
Thermal: Ignore invalid trip points
These should go into other gitignores, like Vim.gitignore
Things started to work kinda, tests fail, lots of logs.
Think the option is supposed to be 'keyboard' in the docs, not 'closeOnEsc'.

We "update the package catalog", not package metadata, not refresh
We also use Chrome :P
We can assume there is always a latest release installed now.
We can just use isNaN for this check in the IE opacity code.
We do need to cache the resolver after all; invalidate it correctly
We don't currently have a way to trace the origin of a mixin
We don't do end of line comments, move them above.
We don't have IE9 supports grid yet, completely didn't see this while refactoring.
We don't need d3_layout_forceCharge anymore.
We don't need to escape cordova plugin --variable args
We don't want to filter out the qunit file.
We don't want to increment the Ajax counter if there isn't a global event.
We have to access the native event handlers/triggers directly, otherwise they won't execute in most modern browsers. Fixes #5124.
We have too many unctions in this function.
We need a JDK, not a JVM
We no longer need to pass --force to npm install
We no longer support globally-triggered events on plain objects. This is a trade-off to having good garbage collection on the objects.
We now stand a chance of supporting MongoDB 3.0.
We only care that some of the html return value is escaped, not necessarily all of it (as is the case in Safari 3.x).
We only support wrapping the first element around an element (all others are ignored). Fixes ticket #4903.
We removed deleteExpando after 1.4.2, for some reason. This caused problems with removeData() (no arguments). Fixes #7209.
We should do a hot code push when static assets added by packages change, just
We shouldn't be capturing the download output; enterJob instead
We want to make sure that we only run the MSIE-specific filter tests if opacity is explicitly not supported.
We were catching exceptions within the success callback of an Ajax request, then causing an error callback to be called (which is incorrect). (Bug #1441)
We're actually at Version 1.1a right now.
We're not adding new selector features in until a new full release. Please discuss features like this in the dev mailing list, and in the bug tracker, before committing code.
We're now at version 1.1.2.
We've decided against .set() and are moving back to .pushStack().

When IE6 & IE7 serve from the cache in async mode, resolves the request asynchronously. Fixes #11778.
When a connection fails permanently due to version number skew, show it in the
When a native browser event is bubbling up the DOM, make sure that the correct isDefaultPrevented value is reflected by jQuery's Event object. Fixes #7793.
When a stream is force-disconnected, don't restart its heartbeat timer.
When binding a change directly to a file input just passthrough to the normal bind. A temporary fix for #5997, needs more investigation.
When calling versionsFrom with no track, default to METEOR-CORE
When changing tags on the proxy, request a certain number of minimum bindings that have those tags
When connecting to Mongo, default autoReconnect parameter to true.

When updating the dev bundle in a checkout, don't delete it until after we've
When upgrading packages, don't pin anything.
When using Sizzle, the API for `d3_select` changes when there is no element to select. When using Sizzle, `undefined` is returned since `[][0] === undefined`. Without Sizzle, `d3_select` returns `null`. This is a problem, because IE9 does not support calling `HTMLElement.insertBefore` (see selection-insert.js) with `undefined` as the second argument; `null` is fine, though.
When we disabled triggering of clicks, we also killed off blur and focus, this fixes that (bug #1440).

You can now assign jQuery to random namespaces - very cool. (Bug #1393)
You can now overwrite values returned from .data() with .bind("getData") - returning a value will override any bound value on that element.
You can now use 'itunes status' as well as 'itunes playing' to show current track
You can't hurry tests, no, you just have to wait.
You had to have an event bound in order to trigger an event - which is not necessarily the case.
You might tweak the ::selection's color too.

coquille
coquille mardkown
core(Scope): rename 'debugger' to 'web inspector' to avoid woes with g3 presubmits
core/test: replaced local qunit copy with qunit via svn:externals; inlined styles specific to polluted.php; kept testrunner.js with just the noConflict call
core: Adding missing radix for paresInt.
core: Ant target to generate openAjaxMetadata; uses http://www.exfer.net/jquery/createjQueryXMLDocs.py to get the data from the wiki, and transforms it using xslt (see build/style.xsl)
core: Fix cut off comment in jQuery.map from c72371f714. Close gh-1379.
core: Fixed #2600: jQuery.extend no longer skips over null properties.
core: Fixed #2605: .data() now accepts null as a value.
core: ant build - add Date and Revision to to header (just like make build)
core: changed jQuery.css to num (uses curCSS) in the height/width methods with dramatically increases performance for height/width
core: cleanup of build - build.js isn't used anywhere
core: deleted useless test/fix.html
core: fixed #2993: .offsetParent() will now return the body element in all browsers for fixed position elements.
core: fixed offset method for FF3 - FF3 seems to have problems reporting the correct values with getBoundingClientRect on the body element
core: height() method wasn't working reliably in Opera - rather than returning the actual client height when called on window, it returned the document's height through document.body.clientHeight. The right value to work with is html.clientHeight
core: make sure all source files end with a single blank line.
core: removed newline from version.txt, easier to use it via Ant then
core: removed outdated docs target from makefile
core: replaced version.js build script in ant build; wasn't used in make anymore anyway
core: revertd last change, breaks width/height logic in css()
core: set version.txt to 1.2.7-pre
core: tests cleanup for compability with qunit updates: stop() now actually accepts an argument (ajax.js); selectors should be confined to fixture(event.js)
correct $resource's success callback execution
correct a misspelling
correct a typo in README
correct answer hits server
correct bookmark prefix
correct css selector for .control-label, required in the docs but not in the CSS files

fx: animate() can now animate any property on a generic object or native wrapper (i.e. window.outerWidth)

that @cvrebert lifestyle
the .meteor/versions file is part of the app control files
the css-split method was using @import syntax that isn't standard.
